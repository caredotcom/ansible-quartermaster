  ## Virtualization related groups

  # Cloud servers all use their Ansible hostname as their shortname.

  cloud:
    shortname: "{{ ansible_hostname }}"

  ## Other groups

  # Various things for all hosts. NOTE that these *can* be overridden by
  # variables in other groups. The special 'all' group is the ONLY group
  # that can be overridden in this way.

  all:

    conf_dir: /ansible/conf
    nameservice_nameservers: [ '10.1.1.53, '10.1.2.53' ]
    os_major_release: '{{ansible_distribution_version | int}}'
    postfix_relayhost: '[10.1.1.25]'
    private_dir: /ansible/private

  # Various things for production hosts.

  prod:
    extra_groups: ['prodsecurity']
    nameservice_nameservers: [ '10.1.101.53, '10.1.102.53' ]
    postfix_relayhost: '[10.1.101.25]'

  # App servers are also status servers.

  app:
    extra_groups: ['status']

  # SMTP relay hosts servers need some Postfix variables.

  relayhost:
    postfix_inet_interfaces: all
    postfix_mynetworks: 127.0.0.0/8 10.1.0.0/16

metagroups:

# NOTE that metagroups are processed *after* we've processed extra_groups,
# which means that (a) you *can* build metagroups based on groups that are
# defined in extra_groups; (b) you *can't* define extra_groups based on
# metagroups. If we ever come up with a use case that requires the latter,
# we can revisit. (This would probably require adding the metagroup logic
# to each pass through extra_groups, which is probably doable, but
# complicated.)

  # Create a $stack-$systype group for all stacks and systypes, and also
  # one for $stack-status.

  - [ {variable: stack}, {variable: systype} ]
  - [ {variable: stack}, {group: status} ]
